R1.3.0  2023-03-13      Jesse Bellister
        Update eget to R0.0.0-0.0.4. - Now builds against EPICS base R7.0.6.1-1.0 to fix the
                                       quotation mark output issue seen in R0.0.0-0.0.3.
        
        Update labca to R3.8.1-0.1.1 - Includes a fix to get it to work with MATLAB 2022b. Also includes
                                       the option to enable debugging output (lcaDebugOn/lcaDebugOff).

        Removes procServ - Per recommendation from Bruce Hill: procServ doesn't build with the EPICS build
                           system and should not be packaged with other extensions. It is also unused on
                           the accelerator side of things.

        Lastly all extensions have been built on RHEL 7 so what is available matches RHEL 6.

R1.2.1  2022-10-13      Jesse Bellister

	Revert eget to R0.0.0-0.0.2 - User reported issue with eget R0.0.0-0.0.3 command returning results 
                                      in a different format (using quotation marks). This breaks multiple existing scripts.
